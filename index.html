        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          I am an enthusiastic Android App Developer & UI/UX Designer currently
          pursuing my B.Tech degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering
          at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad. Besides all
          the tech stuff, I love to read books, listen to music & watch movie
          series in my free time.

            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>
              I came to know about development in the first year of my college
              during winter break. After getting into it, I absolutely fell in
              love with how certain lines of code can create something which can
              be used as a source of information by so many people out there.
              Currently I am into App Development and Frontend Web Development
              and learning the stacks for the Backend Web Development.
